## About project
Nerif is a continuation of my project, which I started in 2020. At that time, I saw myself in Data Science and began developing an algorithm that would predict the results of CS:GO matches.

Although the algorithm was not successful, I decided to imagine what would happen if it were. So I made a full-fledged website in the form of a SaaS platform with regular predictions, success tracking, etc.
